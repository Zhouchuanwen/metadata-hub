- Files: ~253,500 images
- Size:  ~11.1 Gb

# Preparing:
- A folder with large amount of data with sub-directories inside
- A folder with large amount of data with no sub-directories
 
# Benchmarking:
- evaluate how fast crawling and inserting into the table 
   > Crawl through folder with no subdir: 
      + Insert into 3 tables 
      + Insert into 2 tables (tree_walk and file_generic) 
      + Insert into 2 tables (tree_walk and file_generic_data_eav)
      + CPU options: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4

# Answering
- Calcutulate total time if increasing CPU *option
   => How many files per second? (file/s)
   => How many bits per second? (Mb/s)
