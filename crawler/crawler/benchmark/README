# Data
- https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018/data
- Files: ~253,500 images
- Size:  ~11.1 Gb

# Preparing:
- A folder with large amount of data with sub-directories inside
- A folder with large amount of data with no sub-directories (flat)
 
# Benchmarking:
- evaluate how fast crawling and inserting into the table 
   > Crawl through folder with no subdir: 
      + Insert into 3 tables 
      + CPU options: 1 or 4
      => 2 tests: (power=1, dataset=tree) and (power=4, dataset=tree)
      
   > Crawl through folder with subdirs: 
      + Insert into 3 tables 
      + CPU options: 1 or 4
      => 2 tests: (power=1, dataset=flat) and (power=4, dataset=flat)

# Answering
- Calcutulate total time if increasing CPU *option
   => How many files per second? (file/s)
   => How many bits per second? (Mb/s)
   
- Calculate inserting time into
   => table generic (X seconds)
   => table eav (Y seconds)
